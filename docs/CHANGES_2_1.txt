What is new in KD Reports 2.1
=============================

General:
--------
* CMakeLists.txt - don't create a docs target if KDReports is used as a subdirectory in another CMake project

New features:
-------------
* Added report.mainTextDocument() which returns the QTextDocument for the main part of the report
  (no headers, footers, or watermark). This can be used to display the report in a readonly QTextEdit
  or a QTextBrowser.
