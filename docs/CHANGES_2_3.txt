What is new in KD Reports 2.3
=============================

General:
--------

Bugfixes:
-------------
* Preserve resolution in watermark image (issue #42)
* Fix right-aligned tabs not working when setting paragraphs margins

New features:
-------------
* AutoTableElement: add customization functions for header styling, see setHorizontalHeaderFormatFunction and setVerticalHeaderFormatFunction, and their use in the PriceList example.
* Cell: add setCellFormatFunction for customizing cell borders and padding individually, see example in ReferenceReport.
* Cell: add setVerticalAlignment, for vertical centering (or top alignment) of text in table cells, e.g. when using different font sizes in the same row.
* AbstractTablElement: setColumnsConstraints now supports columns with no constraints (just pass {}). The point is to specify a constraint for a column further right than the one without a constraint.
