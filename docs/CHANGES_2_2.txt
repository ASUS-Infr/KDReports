What is new in KD Reports 2.1
=============================

General:
--------
*

Bugfixes:
-------------
* Adding an inline element honours the formatting of that inline element only, the previous element
now has no effect. Previously, addElement() with bold text followed by addInlineElement() with no
formatting, would make the inline element bold erroneously.
* Fix missing icons in the preview dialog

New features:
-------------
* Added Cell::addVerticalSpacing, to insert spacing between paragraphs in table cells
* Added Frame::setPosition, in order to implement floating frames on the left or right side of the document.
* Added Report::setWatermarkFunction, so applications can customize the drawing of the watermark with QPainter.
  This can be useful for company letterhead that involves drawing a few pixmaps here and there, for instance.
* Expose the mmToPixels() function as a helper for drawing the watermark using QPainter.
