What is new in KD Reports 2.0
=============================

General:
--------
* Supports Qt6 in addition to Qt5 (co-installable)
* Minimum Qt version is 5.9
* The qmake buildsystem (via autogen.py) is removed.
* buildsystem - increase CMake min version to 3.3.0
* buildsystem - add an 'uninstall' target
* Python3 bindings for Qt5 and Qt6. See INSTALL-bindings.txt for more information.
* Removed deprecated method setTableBreakingEnabled() (use scaleTo() instead)

New features:
-------------
* Report::anchorAt() method to detect hyperlinks, and a linkActivated() signal in PreviewWidget/PreviewDialog to handle clicking on them.

Bug fixes:
----------
* Autotables: returning a QBrush for Qt::BackgroundRole (or ForegroundRole) now works as expected. Previously only QColor was supported.

Behaviour changes:
-----------------
* Porting away from deprecated QXmlInputSource means that the parsing of whitespace-only XML elements (in templates) has changed.
  This means that an element like <text inline="true"> </text> (whitespace only) is no longer supported (it is parsed as being empty), it needs to be merged with other text elements. A workaround, which unfortunately only works with Qt5, is <![CDATA[ ]]> inside the text element.
  Note that Qt doesn't support xml:space="preserve", which is the reason for this issue.
