KD Reports requires Qt 4.6 or later

If you want KDChart support, please set KDCHARTDIR either as an environment variable or on the qmake command line:

Windows:
set KDCHARTDIR=C:\path\to\kdchart

Unix:
export KDCHARTDIR=/path/to/kdchart

0) From the top directory of your KD Reports installation
 run the "configure" scripts.

   On Windows use depending on the kind of build one of the following;
     configure.bat -shared -debug
     configure.bat -shared -release

   On Unix use depending on the kind of build one of the following;
     ./configure.sh -shared -debug
     ./configure.sh -shared -release

   To define the install-location use for example;
     configure.bat -shared -debug -prefix c:/kdreports
     ./configure.sh -shared -debug -prefix /opt/kdreports



1) Unix

set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to your KD Reports installation lib directory.

If you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set already then use this line:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/kdreports/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

The above has to be added into your .bashrc or similar to remain. It may also of course be run from a shell just before building KD Reports, but in this case your settings will only be available for this shell.

2) MacOS
Proceed as described above, but using DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH instead
of LD_LIBRARY_PATH

3) Windows
Add the path to the KD Reports dll (kdreports\bin) into your PATH environment variable (for running executables)
and the path to the KD Reports lib (kdreports\lib) into your LIB environment variable (for development).

Or run:
set PATH=\path\to\kdreports\bin;%PATH%
set LIB=\path\to\kdreports\lib;%LIB%

4) Compile everything by typing:

make    # Unix,
nmake   # Windows

On Windows you can also use the Qt integration into Visual Studio:
open the toplevel kdreports.pro with "Qt / Open Solution from .pro file".
You still need to adjust the PATH environment variable in order to run the examples.

5) Install headers and libraries by typing:
make install    # Unix
nmake install   # Windows
