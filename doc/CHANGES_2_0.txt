What is new in KD Reports 2.0
=============================

Goals (not implemented yet):
 * Qt6 support

New features:
-------------
* Report::anchorAt() method to detect hyperlinks, and a linkActivated() signal in PreviewWidget/PreviewDialog to handle clicking on them.

General:
--------
* Remove qmake buildsystem
* Python3 bindings for Qt5. See INSTALL-bindings.txt for more information.

Bug fixes:
----------
* Autotables: returning a QBrush for Qt::BackgroundRole (or ForegroundRole) now works as expected. Previously only QColor was supported.

Behaviour changes:
-----------------
* Porting away from deprecated QXmlInputSource means that the parsing of whitespace-only XML elements (in templates) has changed.
  To preserve whitespace only, use CDATA syntax, see textid.xml for an example. Note that Qt doesn't support xml:space="preserve".
